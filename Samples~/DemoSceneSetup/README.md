## Demo Root Scene

This sample shows the intended root scene setup.

This is NOT a working scene that you should play. If you try to play this scene, the `SceneBootstrapper` from this package will instead load a scene called "Root".

The `DemoRoot` scene is for display purposes only. It shows the correct (read: intended) way to set up the root scene to follow this package's intended application flow.

The `DemoActive` scene demonstrates the intended active scene setup. It contains concrete implementations of the abstract classes intended to be used in each active scene. These are dummy implementation, but they demonstrate the intended use and functionality of the system.
