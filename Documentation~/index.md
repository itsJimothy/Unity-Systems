## Unity Systems Package Documentation

This package contains a set of systems that serve as a game-agnostic foundation for managing application flow in Unity projects that utilize additive scene loading with scene groups.

- [Audio](./Audio.md): Sound and music management.
- [Core](./Core.md): Foundational elements for initializing and running the application.
- [Debugging](./Debugging.md): Debugging utilities.
- [EventChannels](./EventChannels.md): Allows for decoupled cross-scene communications via Scriptable Object based event channels.
- [GameFlow](./GameFlow.md): Controls game flow via game state.
- [GameState](./GameState.md): Contains game state definitions and coordinates transitions between them.
- [SceneControl](./SceneControl.md): Handles additive scene loading and unloading.
- [ServiceControl](./ServiceControl.md): Inversion of control via a service locator. Foundational to the entire application flow.
